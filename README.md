***Landing Page CMS, version 0.0.1***

In this project, users may register for access (to be approved by the Administrator) to develop, draft and publish their
own HTML landing page which may be published to a sub-domain.

The Django Admin has been heavily modified to export some functionality to Users. This incorporates the account sign-up
and approval process, and allows the Registered User to manage their account using tools based on the Admin.

NOTE: This project is not up-to-date with more recent standards, nor is it being maintained by any means. 
It is merely illustrative of older Django
mechanisms and serves more as a scaffold for a future rewrite. Originally developed in 2008, and needless to say, much can be done to 
bring it up to par with the
current version of Django as of this writing (1.8), something I may do in a separate repo.
